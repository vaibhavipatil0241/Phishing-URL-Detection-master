The Phishing URL Detection System uses Machine Learning to determine whether a given website URL is legitimate or phishing. The system analyzes structural and lexical features of URLs (such as URL length, number of special characters, domain pattern, and HTTPS usage) and classifies them using trained machine learning models. A web interface allows users to enter any URL and instantly see whether it is safe or suspicious, helping prevent phishing attacks and protect user data.
